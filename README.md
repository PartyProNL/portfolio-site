# Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I use this to showcase some of my previews work, my professional experience and some personality. Built using cutting-edge web technologies and designed with a clean and modern aesthetic, this portfolio represents my work as a software developer. This is the ~~first~~ second version, and knowing myself, definitely not the last.
